      <p>
        We are mix of professionals with varied experience in the technology
        space that spans over 3 decades. We are realistic about the political
        and economic climate we have chosen to operate in and so, have ensured
        we have people on our board with political clout that covers many
        African countries and even the western world. We have project management
        professionals who have delivered projects from Lagos to Sakhalin Islands
        across many sectors from Media, Oil & Gas, FMCG, Banking and Finance to
        SMEs. Service will be a major differentiator, so ITEKKU has among its
        founders, seasoned service professionals who have delivered services
        across all continents to fortune 500 companies and equally have a track
        record delivering services to SMEs in Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.
